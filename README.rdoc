= Ares

Simple library for querying Ares system in Czech republic with translation of
labels.

  http://wwwinfo.mfcr.cz/ares/ares.html.cz

== Usage

Is simple as creating ares instance by finder and calling methods on it:
  
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ares_cz'

  ares = Ares.find(:ico => '27386830')
  ares.found? == true
  ares.company_name == "GravaStar s.r.o."
  ares.subject_type == "P"
  ares.address == {
    :city => "16000 Praha",
    :street => "Charlese de Gaulla 800/3",
    :country => "Česká republika"
  }
  ares = Ares.find(:ico => '666')
  ares.found? == false

It should be posible to find by company name, but is not tested. Also subject
type F needs more testing (see rake test:rcov).

== Dependencies

Only crack for xml parsing. Install with sudo gem install crack.
